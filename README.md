# Indented.Build

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/j4fg3mj2d4ibyt1c?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/indented-automation/indented-build)

Indented.Build centralises the build processes / scripts used by my modules.

The goal of this module is to act as a means of accessing and executing a well maintained set of steps which can apply across a very large module base (public and private).

My build process avoids use of dedicate build task runners such as psake or Invoke*Build on the basis that managing execution of the process is the smallest problem. The process is a bunch of sequentially executed functions with a very short overall build time.

The executor can only be used with PowerShell 5.0 or higher.
